## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Implicit grid is harder than it looks. After a lot of trying, I realize that it's impossible skip the first column without a explicit grid. I could just split it in two containers div and use this to place items, but there is no reason to change it right now.


### Continued development

Definitely I'll focus on learn how to work with grid.(It's a powerful tool to master.)

I'll also focus on improve build complex layouts, this exercise show me how important is work with a good plan.
