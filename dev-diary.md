# What is this?

Just a little diary where I put some daily learnings in this project.
_(Also a way to learn English.)_

## Day 1

 In this day I do just the basics, I started with my CSS Reset and a lot of HTML to make everything clear and easy for me. I still don't know if I'll regret of my choice, but here I decided to use a background on the container div.panel and not on other div panel(or even in a ::before element).

# Day 2

  I just configure the colors in the CSS and make the .profile div looks more like the the final version.
 Other points of interest here: 
  I spent sooo much time trying to make main section use 100% of width and then, after 40 minutes of _debug_, i realize that the parent div(display:grid) hasn't a grid column.

# Day 3
 
 In this point, I started to think about how difficult simple layouts can be. I spent a lot of time making the icons for every category work well with their position. After all this work I just wrapped some elements in .panel__content and add more style to make everything work on mobile.

# Day 4

 When I get started with this project I really thought that I knew grid, so when I try to span the first column in a implict grid I realize: I need to learn _display:grid_.
 I put some hard work to make everything in place and ... Well, it doesn't work exactly how I wished at first, but it's Ok. I'm still learning.

# Day 5
 
 Why it's sooo hard to use implict grids? WC3, DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!
 But I finally started to think about JS and I'm not so worried, this is the part that I know how to work. I'll make it work with the _data.json_ given.
